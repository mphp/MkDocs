#Choosing the right IDE and extensions

A very nice editor that plays well with Yaml is [Atom](https://atom.io). It's free and works on OS X, Windows and Linux.

From Atom you can open a project folder, conveniently accessing all your home assistant files in the editor. And that works also from the AFP drive created in the above step.

Some of the useful extensions that will save you some time are:

[Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and [Linter-js-yaml](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-yaml) will check your syntax is correct, right in the Atom editor and will save you a lot of time.

[Pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) and [Color picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) will be useful when setting up your smart lights.

You can install those extensions directly from the Atom settings page.
