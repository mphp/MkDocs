This site is documenting the steps I have followed to install Home-Assistant, Retropie, this website and some other tools, so that I can put my computers at work.

What I document here may not work for you, but it will surely give you the basics of the setup and can be used as a reference. The setup is mainly based on an Ubuntu amd64 install, although I might sometime mention ways to proceed on a Raspberry Pi, or using a specific distribution like Hassbian.

While both Home-Assistant and Retropie installs are very well documented for Raspberry Pi, it's not the case for a PC using Ubuntu, especially amd64. I am not saying it's not documented I am saying the information is sparsed.
